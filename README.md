## Acknowledgement
This project is built on Linda Lo's simple router code in Fall 2021.

## Description of the project
Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technique that solves the shortage of IPv4 addresses. The local router translates the private IP addresses of local hosts into one of the router's public IP address so that the local hosts can communicate with hosts in the external network. In this project, we follow this NAT handout (https://github.com/mininet/mininet/wiki/Network-Address-Translator-%28NAT%29) to build a simple Network Address Translator that can handle IP address translation for ICMP and TCP packets.
