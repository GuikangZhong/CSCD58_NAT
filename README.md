This project is built on Linda Lo's simple router code in Fall 2021.

## Description of the project
Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technique that solves the shortage of IPv4 addresses. We built a simple Network Address Translator (NAT) that can handle IP address translation for ICMP and TCP packets.
